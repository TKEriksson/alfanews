✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

Next steps:
1. Run prisma dev to start a local Prisma Postgres server.
2. Define models in the schema.prisma file.
3. Run prisma migrate dev to migrate your local Prisma Postgres database.
4. Tip: Explore how you can extend the ORM with scalable connection pooling, global caching, and a managed serverless Postgres database. Read: https://pris.ly/cli/beyond-orm
